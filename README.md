# Ideas

- Omnisharp may be interesting for C# highlighting and completion: https://github.com/nosami/Omnisharp
- Get MiniBufExplorer to work again: https://github.com/fholgado/minibufexpl.vi
- Mark multiple?? https://github.com/adinapoli/vim-markmultiple/
- Tagbar for better ctags support: http://majutsushi.github.com/tagbar/
- ...or maybe something else for CTags support?? http://andrew-stewart.ca/2012/10/31/vim-ctags
